* Lay

A terrible toy tree-walk lisp interpreter. Not to be taken seriously.

** Language features

Arithmetic should work. No further guarantees.

** Syntax

Look at the `samples/fib.lay` file.

* Usage

Start by cloning the repo, and

#+begin_src sh
cargo r               # start an interactive repl
cargo r -- <filename> # interpret the given file
#+end_src
